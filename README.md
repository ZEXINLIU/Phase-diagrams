Phase diagrams are of significant importance in materials science as they provide relationship between phases in a system as a function of temperature, pressure and composition. CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) is used as a reliable method to address the difficulty in determining multicomponent phase diagrams experimentally. But the classic description of excess Gibbs energy by RedlichKister polynomials requires excessive knowledge of the nature of $\alpha$ phase and $m$-$n$ system.  In this paper, we propose a novel numerical framework based on the generalized polynomial chaos expansion (gPC) method, to describe excess Gibbs energy based on mathematical methods, which requires just a few experimental data and hence saves much work to obtain various phase diagrams. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method by estimating Cu-Ni binary system.
